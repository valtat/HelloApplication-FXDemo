In this repository you'll find a couple Java assignments that are called HelloApplication and FXDemo.

HelloApplication has a basic localisation exercise where the language on screen changes on button presses.

FXDemo on the otherhand has a drop down menu with a language selector and textfields for first name, family name and email.
Depending on which language is selected, the information given will be submitted to a language based table in a 
local MySQL database. This is to experiment with a localised app and database.
